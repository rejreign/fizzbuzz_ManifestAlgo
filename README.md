A count of numbers in first 200 wholly divisible by 3, 5, 3 and 5 or not at all

# fizzbuzz QUESTION
Q1) Write a simple function in JavaScript to loop through the first 200 numbers. If the number is divisible by 3, store it in a Fizz array. If the number is divisible by 5, store it in Buzz  array, If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, store it in FizzBuzz array, otherwise store the number in Others.

Use the structure below as a guide:

This is an empty array =>  [ ]

Hint: Look up how to add a record into an array in JavaScript.

let Fizz = [ ];
let Buzz = [ ];
let FizzBuzz = [ ];
let Other  = [ ];

for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
        // do something
     } else if (???) {
         // do something
     } else if (???) {
        // do something
     } else {
         // do something
    }
}

console.log("Total Number of Fizz = "      + Fizz.length);
console.log("Total Number of Buzz = "      + ???.length);
console.log("Total Number of FizzBuzz = "  + FizzBuzz.length);
console.log("Total Number of Other = "    + ???.length);

Go to your console - inside your folder under your name. 
Create a file called FizzBuzz.js
Copy and paste your code inside the folder.
Open the terminal under your name
Run this command node FizzBuzz.js
Note down the solution i.e. what is the count of each of the arrays, after that delete your FizzBuzz code so no one has access to it
Add the solution (entire code) to your github in a different profile
Send me the link to your code (on github)
